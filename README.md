# Mr. Clevenger Simulator
Mr. Clevenger Simulator uses Advanced Unity Simulation technology to enable an accurate recreation of Mr. Clevenger in real time. The player can play as Mr. Clevenger using a series of complex motions using state-of-the-art motion tracking technology, made available by Adobe Mixamo. Furthermore, Unity Navmesh calculations allow for more realistic NPCs, which are able to walk, talk, and interact with their environment. The project emphasizes on the use of LIDAR and photogrammetry in the creation of texture, dimension, and model-accurate structures of a real school that enable practical applications in object preservation, historical reconstruction, and unique implementations in educational training interfaces.
